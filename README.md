## SIM7080 Dev Board

This repository contains the hardware design files (kicad v5) and schematic for SIM7080 Dev Board.

### Introduction
The TechStudio SIM7080 Development Board (The SIM7080 Dev Board) adds wireless access to your IoT project. The on-board SIM7080G module support both LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies that are designed to provide LTE cellular communication to small IoT devices. The build-in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver provides global position information that is often need for tracking applications.

The small form factor and low cost allows IoT system designer/software developer to utilise the development board for “drop-in” deployment, this minimises the risk for developing customised board, and greatly accelerates the time between development and deployment stages.

### Highlighted Features

- Supports LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT mode, and global bands
- Supports GNSS positioning (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo)
- Future-proof eSIM chip footprint reserved on PCB
- On-board battery charger via USB interface
- UART control pins for interfacing with MCU
- On-board Voltage translator controllable based on host MCU power voltage (3.3V/5V)
- Capable to power the host MCU either directly via 3.7V Li-Po battery or via on-board LDO
- GNSS active antenna power control by host MCU
- SIM card slot that supports 1.8V nano SIM card
